            which the velocity was measured, and a variety of other information. OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards [
            <cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-OandM">OandM</a></cite>], [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-SensorML">SensorML</a></cite>] provide a means to annotate sensors and their observations. However, these standards are not integrated and aligned
            with <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data in particular, which are key drivers for creating and maintaining a global and densely interconnected graph of data. With the rise of the Web
            of Things and smart cities and homes more generally, actuators and the data they produce also become first-class citizens of the Web. Given their close relation to sensors, observations, procedures, and features of interest, it is desirable
            to provide a common ontology that also includes actuators and actuation. Finally, with the increasing diversity of data and data providers, definitions such as those for sensors need to be broadened, e.g., to include social sensing. The following
            specifications introduce the new Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) and Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontologies that are set out to provide flexible but coherent perspectives for representing the entities, relations, and activities
            involved in sensing, sampling, and actuation. SOSA provides a lightweight core for SSN and aims at broadening the target audience and application areas that can make use of Semantic Web ontologies. At the same time, SOSA acts as minimal interoperability
            fall-back level, i.e., it defines those common classes and properties for which data can be safely exchanged across all uses of SSN, its modules, and SOSA.</p>

        <p><span data-dobid="hdw">Practitioners</span> using the original Semantic Sensor Network Ontology as defined in the <em><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group </em> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-SSNO">SSNO</a></cite>]
            have identified a major issue in its complexity, partly due to the layering underneath the Dolce-UltraLite (DUL) upper level ontology. In response to this, the new Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology offers several ontology subsets that
            are distinguished mainly through their ontological commitments. This section explains the rationale and method for modularizing SSN, i.e., offering several distinct ontologies that are similar in their domain of discourse, but with different
            ontological commitments, suitable to several use cases and target audiences. For example, SOSA is intended to provide Schema.org-style semantic enrichment capabilities for data repositories managed by an audience broader than typical ontology
            engineers, while still ensuring interoperability with SSN-based repositories.</p>
        <p>Ontology modularization is a common method used in ontology engineering to segment an ontology into smaller parts. In general, ontology modularization aims at providing users of ontologies with the knowledge they require, reducing the scope as
            much as possible to what is strictly necessary in a given use case. Two main categories of ontology modularization can be distinguished.</p>
        <p>The first category comprises those approaches that focus on the composition of existing ontologies by means of integrating and mapping ontologies, most commonly through <code>owl:import</code> statements. OWL import has a direction from a dependent
            ontology to a dependency ontology. Although import is transitive, knowledge is propagated in only one direction. The importing ontology assumes all the meaning of the imported terms used, by including all axioms relevant to the meaning of
            these terms. However, the imported ontology does not capture any of the semantics of the importing ontology.</p>
        <p>The second category comprises of mapping approaches that aim to partition and extract parts of ontologies as modules. These mapping approaches are not necessarily directional, but most approaches of ontology extraction rely on the directionality
            of the imported modules. The main feature of an ontology module under the second category is that it is self-contained, i.e., the module captures the meaning of the imported terms used by including all axioms relevant to the meaning of these

        <h2 id="x3-origins-of-ssn-and-sosa"><span class="secno">3. </span>Origins of SSN and SOSA</h2>
        <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
        <p>Here we briefly review the origins of SSN and SOSA, namely the initial SSN version published by the <em><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Semantic Sensor Network Incubator
          Group </em> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-SSNO">SSNO</a></cite>] and work on Sensor Web Enablement by the OGC. We also highlight the most substantial changes made since the initial release of the SSN ontology.</p>
        <p>Starting in 2002, the OGC's Sensor Web Enablement initiative has developed a generic framework for delivering sensor data, dealing with remote-sensing, moving platforms, and in-situ monitoring and sensing. The Sensor Observation Service defines
            a standard query interface for sensor and observation data, following the pattern established by OGC for their Web Services. The returned XML data conforms with the Sensor Model Language [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-SensorML">SensorML</a></cite>]
            and OMXML [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-OMXML">OMXML</a></cite>], whereby the latter implements Observations and Measurements [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-OandM">OandM</a></cite>]. </p>
        <p>SensorML and O&amp;M are complementary viewpoints. SensorML is 'provider-centric' and encodes details of the sensor along with raw observation data. SensorML is self-contained and highly flexible. This makes life easy for data producers but is
            demanding on consumers. SensorML provides extensive support for serialization of numeric data arrays and is particularly optimized for data that includes multiple parallel streams that must be processed together. For example, the data collected
            by cameras on airborne vehicles must be geo-referenced based on the instantaneous position of the platform and orientation of the camera. In contrast, O&amp;M was designed to be more 'user-centric' with the target of the observation and the
            observed property as first-class objects. O&amp;M works at a higher semantic level than SensorML, but only provides abstract classes for sensors, features of interest and observable properties, expecting the details to be provided by specific
            applications and domains. O&amp;M also provided a model for sampling, since almost all scientific observations are made on a subset of, or proxy for, the ultimate feature of interest. </p>
        <p>The initial <em><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group </em>ontology (SSN) was built around an ontology design pattern called the <em>Stimulus
            Sensor Observation</em> (SSO) pattern [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-SSO-Pattern">SSO-Pattern</a></cite>]. The SSO was developed as a minimal and common ground for heavy-weight ontologies for the use on the Semantic Sensor Web as well
            as to explicitly address the need for light-weight semantics requested by the Linked Data community. The SSO was also aligned to the <em>Dolce-Ultralite </em>upper ontology (DUL). </p>
        <p>The new SSN described in this document is based on a revised and expanded version of this pattern, namely the <em>Sensor, Observation,
            Sample, and Actuator</em> (SOSA) ontology. Similar to the original SSO, SOSA acts as a central building block for the SSN but puts more emphasis on light-weight use and the ability to be used standalone. The axiomatization also changed to
            provide an experience more related to Schema.org. Notable differences include the usage of the Schema.org
            <code>domainIncludes</code> and <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation properties that provide an informal semantics compared to the inferential semantics of their OWL 2 counterparts. In line with the changes implemented for the new SSN, SOSA
            also drops the direct DUL alignment although an optional alignment can be achieved via the SSN-DUL alignment provided in <a href="#DUL_Alignment">Section 6.1</a>. SOSA is also more explicit than SSO in its support for virtual and human sensor.
            Finally, and most notably, SOSA extends SSO's original scope beyond sensors and their observations by including classes and properties for actuators and sampling. SOSA also distinguishes between <code>phenomenonTime</code> and
            <code>resultTime</code>.</p>
        <p>Drawing on considerable implementation and application experience with SSN and sensor and observation ontologies more broadly, the new SSN and SOSA ontologies presented here are set out to address changes in scope and audience, shortcomings of
