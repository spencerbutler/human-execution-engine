      <p>ActivityPub provides two layers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>A server to server federation protocol</b>
          (so decentralized websites can share information)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A client to server protocol</b>
          (so users, including real-world users, bots, and other automated processes,
          can communicate with ActivityPub using their accounts on servers,
          from a phone or desktop or web application or whatever)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        ActivityPub implementations can implement just one of these things or
        both of them.
        However, once you've implemented one, it isn't too many steps to
        implement the other, and there are a lot of benefits to both (making
        your website part of the decentralized social web, and being able to
        use clients and client libraries that work across a wide variety of
        social websites).
      </p>

      <p>
        In ActivityPub, a user is represented by "<a href="#actors">actors</a>"
        via the user's accounts on servers.
        User's accounts on different servers correspond to different actors.
        Every Actor has:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>An <code>inbox</code>:</b>  How they get messages from the world</li>
        <li><b>An <code>outbox</code>:</b> How they send messages to others</li>
      </ul>

        ActivityPub uses [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ActivityStreams">ActivityStreams</a></cite>] for its vocabulary.
        This is pretty great because ActivityStreams includes all the common
        terms you need to represent all the activities and content flowing
        around a social network.
        It's likely that ActivityStreams already includes all the vocabulary
        you need, but even if it doesn't, ActivityStreams can be extended
        via [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a></cite>].
        If you know what JSON-LD is, you can take advantage of the cool linked
        data approaches provided by JSON-LD.
        If you don't, don't worry, JSON-LD documents and ActivityStreams can be
        understood as plain old simple JSON.
        (If you're going to add extensions, that's the point at which JSON-LD
        really helps you out).
      </p>

        (Activities sent around in ActivityPub generally follow the pattern of
        some activity by some actor being taken on some object.
        In this case the activity is a Create of a Note object, posted by a
        Person).

            <a href="#Overview">ActivityPub</a> is one of several related
            specifications being produced by the Social Web Working Group.
            Implementers interested in alternative approaches and complementary
            protocols should review [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Micropub">Micropub</a></cite>] and the overview document
            [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Social-Web-Protocols">Social-Web-Protocols</a></cite>].

    <section id="conformance"><!--OddPage--><h2 id="x2-conformance"><span class="secno">2. </span>Conformance</h2>
<p>
  As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples,
  and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is
  normative.
</p>
--
          The ActivityPub specification is designed so that once either of
          these protocols are implemented, supporting the other is of very
          little additional effort.
          However, servers may still implement one without the other.
          This gives three conformance classes:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Client</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
            client portion of the client to server protocol.
          </dd>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Server</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
            server portion of the client to server protocol.
          </dd>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Federated Server</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of
            the federation protocols.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          It is called out whenever a portion of the specification only applies
          to implementation of the federation protocol.
          In addition, whenever requirements are specified, it is called out
          whether they apply to the client or server (for the client-to-server
          protocol) or whether referring to a sending or receiving server in
          the server-to-server protocol.

        ActivityPub are built.
        Objects are often wrapped in Activities and are contained in streams of
        Collections, which are themselves subclasses of Objects.
        See the [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Activity-Vocabulary">Activity-Vocabulary</a></cite>] document, particularly the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#types">Core Classes</a>;
        ActivityPub follows the mapping of this vocabulary very closely.
      </p>
      <p>
        ActivityPub defines some terms in addition to those provided by
        ActivityStreams.
        These terms are provided in the ActivityPub
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a>

        object definitions.
        Implementers <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> include additional context as appropriate.

      <p>
        ActivityPub shares the same

          URI / IRI conventions as in ActivityStreams</a>.

        (A server should do something at least as robust as checking that
        the object appears as received at its origin, but mechanisms
        such as checking signatures would be better if available).
        No particular mechanism for verification is authoritatively specified by
        this document, but please see <a href="#security-considerations">Security
        Considerations</a> for some suggestions and good practices.

          ActivityPub extends this requirement; all objects distributed by the

          are intentionally transient (short lived activities that are not
          intended to be able to be looked up, such as some kinds of chat
          messages or game notifications).
          These identifiers must fall into one of the following groups:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Publicly dereferencable URIs, such as HTTPS URIs, with their
            authority belonging to that of their originating server.
            (Publicly facing content <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> use HTTPS URIs).
          </li>
          <li>
            An ID explicitly specified as the JSON <code>null</code> object,
            which implies an anonymous object (a part of its parent context)
          </li>
--
	  [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Activity-Vocabulary">Activity-Vocabulary</a></cite>], ActivityPub extends the <code>Object</code> by
	  supplying the <code>source</code> property.
          The <code>source</code> property is intended to convey some
          sort of source from which the <code>content</code> markup
          was derived, as a form of provenance, or to support future
          editing by clients.
          In general, clients do the conversion from <code>source</code>
          to <code>content</code>, not the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of <code>source</code> is itself an object
          which uses its own <code>content</code> and <code>mediaType</code>
          fields to supply source information.

            For example, Alyssa P. Hacker likes to post to her ActivityPub
            powered blog via an Emacs client she has written, leveraging
            <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>.
            Later she switches to editing on her phone's client, which
            has no idea what <code>text/x-org</code> is or how to render
            it to HTML, so it provides a text box to edit the original
            <code>content</code> instead.
            A helpful warning displays above the edit area saying,
            "This was originally written in another markup language we don't
            know how to handle.  If you edit, you'll lose your original
            source!"
            Alyssa decides the small typo fix isn't worth losing her nice
            org-mode markup and decides to make the update when she gets
            home.

        ActivityPub actors are generally one of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#actor-types">
          ActivityStreams Actor Types</a>,
        but they don't have to be. For example, a
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-profile">
          Profile</a> object
        might be used as an actor, or a type from an ActivityStreams extension.
        Actors are <a href="#retrieving-objects">retrieved</a> like any other
        Object in ActivityPub.
        Like other ActivityStreams objects, actors have an <code>id</code>,
        which is a URI.
        When entered directly into a user interface (for example on a login
        form), it is desirable to support simplified naming.
        For this purpose, ID normalization <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> be performed as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the entered ID is a valid URI, then it is to be used directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it appears that the user neglected to add a scheme for a URI that
          would otherwise be considered valid, such as
          <code>example.org/alice/</code>, clients <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> attempt to provide
          a default scheme, preferably <code>https</code>.
--
        ActivityPub does not dictate a specific relationship between
        "users" and Actors; many configurations are possible.
        There may be multiple human users or organizations controlling an
        Actor, or likewise one human or organization may control multiple
        Actors. Similarly, an Actor may represent a piece of software,
        like a bot, or an automated process.
        More detailed "user" modelling, for example linking together of Actors which
        are controlled by the same entity, or allowing one Actor to be presented
        through multiple alternate profiles or aspects, are at the discretion
        of the implementation.

        Servers communicate with other servers and propagate information across

        An Activity sent over the network <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> have an <code>id</code>,

--
          it is worth noting that ActivityPub's targeting and delivery
          mechanism overlaps with the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a>
          specification, and the two specifications may interoperably
          combined.
          In particular, the <code>inbox</code> property is the same between
          ActivityPub and Linked Data Notifications, and the targeting
          and delivery systems described in this document are supported
          by Linked Data Notifications.
          In addition to JSON-LD compacted ActivityStreams documents, Linked
          Data Notifications also supports a number of RDF serializations
          which are not required for ActivityPub implementations.
          However, ActivityPub implementations which wish to be more broadly
          compatible with Linked Data Notifications implementations may wish to
          support other RDF representations.

            Thus ActivityPub provides an optional mechanism for serving these

          <p>

            objects to said <code>sharedInbox</code>.
            Thus in this scenario, the remote/receiving server participates
            in determining targeting and performing delivery to specific
            inboxes.

          <p>
            Additionally, if an object is addressed to the

          ActivityPub uses authentication for two purposes; first, to
          authenticate clients to servers, and secondly in federated
          implementations to authenticate servers to each other.

        <p>
          Unfortunately at the time of standardization, there are no strongly
          agreed upon mechanisms for authentication.

          Servers should not trust client submitted content, and

          <p>
            Servers should implement protections against denial-of-service
            attacks from other, federated servers.
            This can be done using, for example, some kind of ratelimiting
            mechanism.
            Servers should be especially careful to implement this protection
            around activities that involve side effects.
            Servers <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em> also take care not to overload servers with

        Erin Shepherd built the initial version of this specification, borrowed
        from the ideas in the

        document, mostly as a complete rewrite of text, but sharing most of

        ActivityPub has been shaped by the careful input of many members in the
        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Social Working Group.
        ActivityPub especially owes a great debt to Amy Guy, who has done more
        than anyone to map the ideas across the different Social Working Group
        documents through her work on [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-Social-Web-Protocols">Social-Web-Protocols</a></cite>].
        Amy also laid out the foundations for a significant refactoring of the
        ActivityPub spec while sprinting for four days with Christopher Allan
        Webber.
        These revisions lead to cleaner separation between the client to server
        and server components, along with clarity about ActivityPub's relationship
        to [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-LDN">LDN</a></cite>], among many other improvements.
        Special thanks also goes to Benjamin Goering for putting together the
        implementation report template.
        We also thank mray for producing the spectacular tutorial illustrations
        (which are licensed under the same license as the rest of this
