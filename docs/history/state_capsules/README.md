# State Capsules (Historical)

## Status

NON-AUTHORITATIVE HISTORY

This directory contains historical working notes such as session reports, post-mortems, and task summaries.

## Rules

- This directory is NOT a canonical entry point.
- No workflow may REQUIRE reading anything in this directory.
- Nothing in this directory grants or implies authority to ACT.
- AUTHZ is granted only via the explicit chat-line sentinel:
  `AUTHZ: APPROVED_TO_ACT`
- Commit-time authority is what matters; working tree and notes are provisional.
- If content here becomes durable doctrine, it MUST be promoted to `docs/doctrine/`.

## Prior Location

These historical notes previously lived at `docs/history/state_capsules/`. That location is deprecated to avoid any implication of control-plane authority.

## History

- [CI/CD greenline post-mortem (merge conflicts, YAML/shell failure modes, pager enforcement)](2026-01-26/HEE-CI-CD-Greenline-Postmortem.md)
