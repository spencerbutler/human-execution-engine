chat: OPS-HEE-Docs-Consolidation-Plan
purpose: >
  Checkpoint PLAN state for HEE documentation consolidation prior to any ACT.
  Preserve authority decisions, execution scope, and blockers.

context:
  project: human-execution-engine
  phase: PLAN (pre-ACT)
  authority_model: A
  scope: NARROW
  timestamp: 2026-01-25
  governance:
    admission_control: Strong
    wrapper_required: scripts/hee_git_ops.sh
    plan_act_boundary_enforced: true

decisions:

  - Decision: Docs vs Prompts Authority Model A
    Rationale: docs/ is canonical for normative and user-facing documentation; prompts/ is agent execution guidance
    Impact: Conflicting files in both locations are BLOCKED pending human resolution
  - Decision: Docs vs Prompts Authority Model A
    Rationale: docs/ is canonical for normative and user-facing documentation; prompts/ is agent execution guidance
    Impact: Conflicting files in both locations are BLOCKED pending human resolution
    HEE_Compliance: Admission Control + Authority Doctrine

  - Decision: Initial ACT scope limited to HIGH-confidence moves only
    Rationale: Minimize risk; defer ambiguous classifications
    Impact: Only five files approved for initial execution
    HEE_Compliance: Safe Incremental Execution

approved_narrow_act_scope:

- docs/HEE.md -> docs/doctrine/HEE.md
- docs/HEER.md -> docs/specs/HEER.md
- docs/HEE_POLICY.md -> docs/doctrine/HEE_POLICY.md
- docs/SECURITY.md -> docs/doctrine/SECURITY.md
- docs/SPEC.md -> docs/specs/SPEC.md

    - docs/STATE_CAPSULE_GUIDE.md
    - docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md

    - docs/ROADMAP.md
    - docs/VIOLATION_METRICS.md
    - docs/HEE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
    - docs/HEE_VENDOR_HARDENING_SPEC.md
    - templates/ vs TEMPLATES/ naming resolution

open_threads:

- Resolve docs vs prompts authority conflicts for BLOCKED files
- Decide classification for MEDIUM/LOW confidence files
- Decide whether to extend hee_git_ops.sh with mv/mkdir ops

act_preconditions:

- Explicit APPROVED_TO_ACT token from human
- Use scripts/hee_git_ops.sh exclusively
- Stop after first commit boundary
- No BLOCKED or DEFERRED items included

next_chat_bootstrap:

- If proceeding to execution: authorize ACT for narrow scope only
- If pausing: resume from this capsule without re-analysis
