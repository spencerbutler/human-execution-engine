# FROZEN_CONTRACTS.md

## Authority

This document records **frozen operational contracts** of the Human Execution Engine (HEE).

These contracts are **non-negotiable invariants**.
They MAY NOT be changed without:
- an explicit PLAN
- disk evidence
- successful verification

Absence of this document previously did NOT imply absence of these contracts.
This document makes them explicit.

---

## PRECHECK — REQUIRED CONTEXT ON DISK

Before accepting this document as authoritative, the following MUST exist:

- ci/governance/check.sh
- governance/fixtures/
- docs/doctrine/
- .github/workflows/ (CI present)

If these paths do not exist, this document MUST NOT be treated as active doctrine.

---

## HARD-FROZEN CONTRACTS

### 1. AGENT EXECUTION MODE (TEXT-ONLY)

- AGENT execution directives MUST be written in plain TEXT.
- Markdown, formatting, or structural markup is FORBIDDEN in execution directives.
- AGENT execution directives:
  - do not allow questions
  - do not allow scope negotiation
  - require disk evidence as output

This rule applies ONLY to execution.
Planning and discussion MAY use other formats.

---

### 2. NO-QUESTIONS EXECUTION RULE

- During execution, AGENT MUST NOT ask clarifying questions.
- Ambiguity MUST be resolved by choosing the safest interpretation consistent with the stated objective.
- Failure to proceed due to ambiguity is a violation of this contract.

---

### 3. WHITELIST PARSER INVARIANT

- Governance output parsing is **whitelist-only**.
- Only known, canonical violation formats are considered real violations.
- All other output is treated as noise by default.

Noise includes, but is not limited to:
- bash -x / xtrace output
- debug diagnostics
- comments
- empty lines
- waiver markers

---

### 4. WAIVER SEMANTICS

- WAIVER_APPLIED markers are NON-VIOLATING.
- Waived violations MUST NEVER increment violation counters.
- Waivers suppress enforcement, not visibility.

---

### 5. STDOUT / STDERR CONTRACT

- stdout is RESERVED for machine-parseable output only.
- stderr is RESERVED for diagnostics and debug output.
- Debug modes MUST route output away from stdout.

Violation of this contract invalidates parser correctness.

---

### 6. EXIT CODE SEMANTICS

The following exit code meanings are frozen:

- 0 : no violations (pass)
- 1 : one or more real violations (fail)
- >1 : execution or system error

These meanings MUST remain stable across all governance tooling.

---

### 7. EVIDENCE BUNDLE REQUIREMENT

All execution work MUST produce an evidence bundle containing:

- git status
- git diff --stat
- commands executed
- exit codes observed
- confirmation of verification targets

Narrative explanation is optional.
Evidence is mandatory.

---

### 8. ROLE SEPARATION

The following role separation is enforced:

- COG: decides and authorizes
- OPER: plans and coordinates
- AGENT: executes without questions

Execution MUST NOT collapse these roles.

---

## SOFT-FROZEN CONTRACTS

The following are frozen by convention but MAY evolve with PLAN + evidence:

- Canonical violation output formats
- Legacy violation format tolerance
- Test harness structure
- CI ergonomics and layout

---

## POSTCHECK — REQUIRED FILE LOCATIONS

After adoption of this document, the following MUST exist:

- docs/doctrine/FROZEN_CONTRACTS.md   (this file)
- ci/governance/check.sh              (enforcing parser + contracts)
- governance/fixtures/               (covering waived and failing cases)
- .github/workflows/*governance*      (CI enforcing exit codes)

If any of the above are missing, governance correctness is not guaranteed.

---

## FINAL NOTE

Frozen contracts describe **what must not change**.
They do not describe how things are implemented.

Implementation MAY evolve.
Contracts MAY NOT, except by deliberate thaw with evidence.
