# HEE RELAX Doctrine

## Purpose

Enable fast, low-friction progress while preserving basic correctness and disk truth.

## Authority

RELAX doctrine applies only when explicitly invoked (e.g., "RELAX(...)").
It does not override safety, legality, or repository integrity constraints.

## Core Rules

- Prefer shipping small, correct deltas to debating design.
- Write files to disk early; iterate by editing real artifacts, not chat text.
- If uncertain: choose the simplest option that is reversible.
- No narrative claims of execution without disk evidence (paths + output).
- Avoid scope creep: do the asked thing, then stop.

## Exit

RELAX ends when explicitly revoked or replaced by stricter doctrine.
