# math/

This directory holds **mathy reference material** used to support correctness in HEE:
definitions, invariants, small proofs/lemmas, and other “show your work” notes.

## Scope

- ✅ Definitions and invariants that can be referenced by code/specs/docs
- ✅ Small lemmas/proofs that justify a rule or constraint
- ❌ Not doctrine text (doctrine lives elsewhere)
- ❌ Not a dumping ground for long essays

## Conventions

- Keep each note small and linkable.
- Prefer examples + falsifiable statements over narrative.
- If a note implies a repo change, link to the relevant PR/issue.

## Index

- See: docs/math/README.md
