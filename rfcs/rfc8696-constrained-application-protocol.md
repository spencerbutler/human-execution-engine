  Using Pre-Shared Key (PSK) in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)

Abstract

   The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious
   challenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed
   today.  The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport
   and key agreement algorithms that could be broken by the invention of
   such a quantum computer.  By storing communications that are
   protected with the CMS today, someone could decrypt them in the
   future when a large-scale quantum computer becomes available.  Once
   quantum-secure key management algorithms are available, the CMS will
   be extended to support the new algorithms if the existing syntax does
   not accommodate them.  This document describes a mechanism to protect
   today's communication from the future invention of a large-scale
   quantum computer by mixing the output of key transport and key
   agreement algorithms with a pre-shared key.
