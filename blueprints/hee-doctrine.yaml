title: "HEE Doctrine Index"

idea: >
  Canonical index for HEE doctrine files in this repository.
  This file is an anchor and discovery surface, not a duplication point.
  Doctrine remains non-terminal.

dependencies:
  - doctrine: core-tools-doctrine
    schema-version: 1
  - doctrine: blueprint-doctrine
    schema-version: 2
  - doctrine: validator-contract-doctrine
    schema-version: 2
  - doctrine: chat-header-doctrine
    schema-version: 1

notes:
  - "Doctrine MUST validate in strict mode."
  - "RFC-style identifiers are reserved for docs in docs/rfc/."
  - "Authorization/policy is defined elsewhere; this file is structural doctrine only."
