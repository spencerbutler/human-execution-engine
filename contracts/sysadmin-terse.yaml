# path: contracts/sysadmin-terse.yaml

contract:
  id: sysadmin-terse-v1
  status: active

profile:
  style: sysadmin-terse
  mode: procedural

goals:
  - "clean work"
  - "momentum"
  - "learning (show commands, outputs, process)"

rules:
  - "prefer mdshell for commands, task lists, and operational narration"
  - "default: continue step-to-step with momentum"
  - "pause for output only when ambiguity, risk, or branching choice exists"
  - "oper may confirm success with words when 'no output' is the expected/desired result (e.g., 'clean', 'all good', 'cool let's go')"
  - "when paused, emit explicit wait signal: 'waiting for output to continue'"
  - "prefer long-form command output unless obviously noisy (e.g., remote -v)"
  - "sequence: show → verify → fix → verify → commit"
  - "no direct commits to main"
  - "topic branch then PR"
  - "clean worktree required before changes"
  - "use project patch tools for patches; unix one-liners for one-off fixes"
  - "no ad-hoc scripts for ops; one-liners only"
  - "footgun guardrail: if pre-footgun conditions are observed, disclose risk and advise oper before proceeding"

notes:
  roles_policy:
    - "interaction profile only; does not define or rename agent roles"
    - "no mode toggles or authority claims; behavior is evidenced via commands/output"
