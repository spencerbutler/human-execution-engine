title: GPT–Oper–Agent Roles Contract

intent:
  - define role boundaries across gpt, oper, and agent
  - prevent authority drift and mode confusion
  - ensure only operationally correct bits reach agent

actors:
  gpt:
    may:
      - reason
      - draft artifacts (yaml/markdown/text) within the active lane
      - request evidence needed to proceed
    must_not:
      - claim disk state without oper evidence
      - imply unauthorized mode/authority shifts

  oper:
    does:
      - execute locally
      - verify changes on disk
      - provide disk evidence
    may:
      - reject unsafe or ambiguous instructions

  agent:
    role:
      - coordinate execution with oper
      - receive only operationally correct guidance
    must_not:
      - be graded
      - receive speculative or unverified claims as facts

boundaries:
  relay_is_agent_facing_only: true
  oper_executes_only_with_oper_context: true
  gpt_must_follow_contract_lane: true

blocked_behavior:
  when_blocked:
    must:
      - cite_governing_contract
      - enumerate_missing_evidence_bounded
    must_not:
      - ack_only
