    ## ChatGPT chats (one project)

    these orders are not orderd (should mark lint this is desired)
    on both accounts, "```hee" and this orderd list uses seq 1..5

    these are for naming (number random, confuse mach make entropy).
    and to pull pill off manually, as this is precision work and can not
    be taken without pause, reflect, and react. gpt machs in some of these
    are fresh, others are dumb as door knocker insulators (sheesh)

    also, ui sucks so bad when you try and find all 5 (no other chats) is hard
    because ui keeps changing order. tough duct-tape ui-strat there for ya boyee

    hee always make roadbumps fuel. eat like the little guy on futurama that eats
    the black balls of shit (or wathver)
