# GPT Prompting Guide

## Purpose

Standardize the way opers interact with GPT (primary session driver).

HEE strives for completely determined IN and OUT, given the same data.

IN <-> hee <-> OUT

Due to the nature of HEE (1st leg, 2nd leg, 3rd leg => Dog Food) INPUTs and OUTPUTs
will begin to become both IN and OUT after evidence suppots the object(s).
It is a lot of fun to watch the IN/OUT grow (number of stools) over time.

### INPUT

- session: a sourced input of reasoning and action
- evidence: data living as immutable evidence (ie. disk, dns, oid, etc.)
- policy: set of doctrine rattified by HEE
- doctrine: canonized HEE policy
- contract: binding rules of engagement between HEE objects
- blueprint: a set of plans and contracts needed to produce a useful HEE object
- plan: a Work Unit (WU) comprised of smaller, ordered, work units (wu)
- WU: one ordered phase in a plan
- wu: one ordered step in a WU
- step: one ordered step in a wu or WU (step -> wu -> WU -> PLAN -> BLUEPRINT)

### OUTPUT

- pill: a generic YAML file used to encapsulate session/idea/brainstorm data
- card: yaml files used to capture moments in time, and general knowledge
- ui: new
  - hee_epoch: 1770799033

    v0: html render + tiny server. Next: registrar + trace_chain + gh_link.

## Prompts

### Quick Session (real example)

#### Purpose

Get in and out quickly and save all data to disk.

#### Chat Header

The chat header should be sent as k:v YAML.
These keys are specific to this chat, see [Errata](#errata) for more info.

~~~yaml
chat: market thesis
purpose: chit chat
oper: spencer

##### Prompt

before we are done with this session (soon) I would like a card of this in the repo.

- files:
  - [../../hee/cards/gpt-prompting-guide.md](../../hee/cards/gpt-prompting-guide.md)
- ps1:
  - spencer@flippy ~/git/human-execution-engine (docs/formalize-gpt-prompts) $

#### Errata

- TODO(spencer): update below - gpt will do fun times here
  - sed -n '83,120' should do it
  - chat header
  - reconcile, merge and strip this bare and machgen a proper human facing doc, duh
    - preserve provenance, duh

##### QRL errata

- ts: {hee-epoch} is new and is meant to be a global epoch time
- hee-obj: is just now trying to assert authority, and a WiP
- soa: this is current on disk anchor and must be followed by all new process and policy
- repo-files: need plan to make sure it is up to day and useful
- canon-files: needs review, ideally all foundational docs are cannon (ie blueprints/ contracts/ schema/ plans/)
- handoff-policy: this is the current "checkpoint-supergoldstar-handoff" contract that still needs ratification
- dric: this is the old dric-v1 that needs to be updated so that sub.dric contracts can thrive (depends on GCIS)
- contract: the contract between the current gpt and the oper (dric,new TBD)
- sub-contract: this will be (proposed) {GCIS} -> {DRIC-v2} -> {gpt-oper-TBD}

##### Chat Header (needs ratification)

~~~yaml
# required

purpose: "general pupose, can be vague/specific"

# to be added to the new chat as soon as INUID is created by chat-gpt-ui (quick)

# optional
