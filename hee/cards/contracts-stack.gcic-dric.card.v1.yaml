spec:
  status: wip
  purpose: formal adoption path for gcic and dric artifacts; reduce need to update top stack; plug subcontracts.
  discovered:
    gcic_md: contracts/gcic.v1.md
    dric_md: contracts/dric.v1.md
    dric_yaml: contracts/dric-v1.contract.yaml
  decisions:
    - gcic is top level contract
    - dric family is gpt related and must be renamed because it is broader than design to relay
    - dric subs delegate; prefer plug in specific contracts rather than editing top stack repeatedly
  needs_dif: true
  dif:
    - define new dric family name
    - define dric sub naming: dric-v1-subNNNN
    - define how gcic references dric family and subs
