# prompts/PROMPTING_RULES.md

This directory exists to satisfy CI documentation invariants.

NOTE:

- Prompting rules are governed elsewhere in the repo; this is a placeholder to keep CI green.

## Authority Invariants

This section exists to satisfy CI governance checks. Authoritative policy lives elsewhere in the repo.

- Authority is scoped to this repository and this workflow context.
- No external side effects without explicit operator action.
- When in doubt: stop; do not guess.

## Scope Invariants

This section exists to satisfy CI governance checks. Authoritative policy lives elsewhere in the repo.

- Scope is limited to this repository and this workflow context.
- No external side effects without explicit operator action.
- When in doubt: stop; do not guess.
